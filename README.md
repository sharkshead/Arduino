# Arduino
The current repo includes:

ArcSched - a milli-seconds resolution function schedular that gives you multi-tasking features not present in the standard Arduino IDE.

ArcSleep and ArcSleepWDT - works with ArcSched to make putting the ATmel 𝜇C to sleep easy, waking up when there is another job to run or when an interrupt occurs.

It runs on any ATmel processor, and is designed to be used from the Arduino IDE.

Move the contents of the libraries/ directory into your SketchBook's libraries/ directory.

This repo contains software that is used in each Shark's Head module.
